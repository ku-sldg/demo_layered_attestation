All --

I now have code that reads email msgs, extracts
each header into its own string.

For headers that contain addresses, such as To:,
CC:, From:, and Reply-to:, it further breaks them
down into fields at comma-separated boundaries,
and digests each field into pre-text such as
"Guttman, Joshua D.", post-text such as (Joshua
D. Guttman), username, and a sequence of domains.

So the actual email address is username@x where x
is the result of concatenating the domains using
the separator '.'.  And the address field, for
this x, is

  pre-text ^ username ^ "@" ^ x ^ post-text

The lines of the email body are simply retained as
a sequence of lines.  

What should the email guard do with a msg?  Well,
my take is that there should be two steps.

*First*, an incoming msg is subjected to
*rewriting*.  Rewriting may reject a msg as
unsalvageable, it may find that no changes are
needed, or it may perform a sequence of rewrite
steps, yielding a new msg.

This is then written out to a new location, unless
it was rejected.

*Second*, a rewritten msg is inspected to
determine whether it is acceptable with no further
rewriting.  This can be done using the same
recipes as rewriting, with the proviso that any
actual rewriting results in failure, just as much
as the actions that previously caused rejection as
unsalvageable.

So, attached -- in pristine text format -- is a
specification for the configuration files, as well
as a description of the effect of each clause,
both in rewriting mode and in final inspection
mode.

What do you think?  What would you change?  What's
just missing?  Where have I gone ultra-baroque?

I have one additional elaboration in mind, but I
thought it would be good to give y'all this
version so you could get the main picture.
